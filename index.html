		<h2 class="blue-underline">Bio</h2>
		<p>I have always had an interest in technology and design. I graduated from MTSU in 2006 with a degree in graphic design. While I started doing work mostly in print, over the years I have picked up more and more knowledge and interest in web design and development. Finally in the spring of 2017, after being frustrated in the pace of my skill development. I made the decision to pivot to dive deeply into full-stack web development. I particulary am interested in using javascript everywhere since it has become such a widely implemented programing interface for a number of technologies.</p>
